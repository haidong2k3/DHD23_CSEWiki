AI - ML - DS
AI: mimic & replicate human intelligent
ML: automaticaly learn and improve from experiences (without explicitly the program)
DS: umbrella term - encompasses data analytics, data mining, ML, AI,...

data gathering
data transformation => data management, data integration
prediction

supervised & unsupervised learning & reinforcement Learning

Deeplearning is a subfield of machine learning
Deeplearning uses artificial neural networks to simulate human brain by dsa
Deedlearning is usually used for data with un-precise structure

ML cung cấp cho máy tính khả năng "học"
AI tạo ra các máy tính "thông minh" từ khả năng "học" đó
DS cung cấp khả năng "xử lý" (data processing)

- DS is the use of statistical methods to find patterns in the data -> simlilar to "statistical ML"

ML Techniques
- Statistical modeling
- Visualization
- Pattern Recognition

ML List of features
ML conducting methods
